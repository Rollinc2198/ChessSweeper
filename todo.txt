make mines more apparent when piece lands on it
d4 mine e4 doesnt work, but d4 mine exd3 does???
sometimes it bugs and you have to drag twice to move pieces
make threefold repetition not break all the time
make spectators able to see minesweeper state for each player (white/black dot/flag in top right corner)
